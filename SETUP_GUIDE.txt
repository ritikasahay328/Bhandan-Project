# Setup Guide for Bhandan Project

## Cloning the Repository
To get started, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ritikasahay328/Bhandan-Project.git
cd Bhandan-Project
```

## Prerequisites
You only need **Python 3** installed for this static website.

## Running the Application
Start the site with:

```bash
python3 server.py
```

Optional custom port:

```bash
PORT=8000 python3 server.py
```

## Accessing the Application
Once the server is running, open:

```text
http://localhost:4173
```

If you used a custom `PORT`, replace `4173` with that value.

---

If the site says it can't be reached, confirm the server is running in the same terminal and that the URL port matches the running port.
